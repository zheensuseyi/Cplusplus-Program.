*1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving*

The goal of this project was to create a banking tool so that a user can check on their investments and how it will look in the future. This program asked for the users input on their initial investment, monthly deposits, APR, and number of years. The program then proceeded to display two tables. One table for the users investments without monthly deposits and one table with monthly deposits.

*2. What did you do particularly well?*

This project went perfectly and was the only project where I received a perfect grade on (This instructor was a very precise grader so I am really proud of this). The highlight of this project was definetly the formatting and the neatness of the program which was definetly challenging to do right.

*3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*

I could have definetly made my code neater that is an issue I have especially when it comes to making functions. As for making my code more secure, all of my functions and variables are public so that may not be completely secure and is something I would implement in the future. As I code more and learn more I think this project would look completely different and definetly be a lot neater.

*4.Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*

The pieces of code I found the most challenging to write was definetly my nested for loops which I needed to fill out my data tables. It was a constant struggle of trial and error and looking up examples of nested for loops on google and youtube that I was finally able to figure out what I was doing wrong and implement it in my code. Google and youtube have been a huge help to me throughout my coding journey and I am sure that if I am blessed enough to get a programming job these resources will continue helping.

*5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?* 

The skills from this project that will transfer would be the implementation of for loops and the ability to make and call functions. In my future classes where its just going to get harder and harder, this project (which took me about 3 days to complete) has taught me that I AM able to program efficent software if I just put my mind to it.

*6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*

I made sure to add comments for pretty much every line inside the code and I made sure these comments can be read by a non-technical audience. As for making my code super neat and organized, that is something I am still struggling with that I hope to overcome in the future. I still have too much stuff going on in main() when I could be using more functions.
