*1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving*

The goal of this project was to create a banking tool so that a user can check on their investments and how it will look in the future. This program asked for the users input on their initial investment, monthly deposits, APR, and number of years. The program then proceeded to display two tables. One table for the users investments without monthly deposits and one table with monthly deposits.

*2. What did you do particularly well?*

This project went perfectly and was the only project where I received a perfect grade on (This instructor was a very precise grader so I am really proud of this). The highlight of this project was definetly the formatting and the neatness of the program which was definetly challenging to do right.

*3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*

I could have definetly made my code neater that is an issue I have especially when it comes to making functions. As for making my code more secure, all of my functions and variables are public so that may not be completely secure and is something I would implement in the future. As I code more and learn more I think this project would look completely different and definetly be a lot neater.

*4. What was the most significant concept that you learned?*

The most significant concept I learned in this project was getting my for loop to fill out a data table and implementing that in the forms of functions that I called in main(). There were some other concepts I struggled on for a bit like having placeholder variables to use in a nested for loop.

*5. Were there any shifts in your understanding of a particular concept? If so, what was that concept and how did it change?* 

The big shifts in my understanding of a particular concept was definetly filling the table out using multiple functions and simple print statements in main. What I did in this project was make my datatables as a function and filled it out with for loops and print statements in main(). I am sure there are more efficent ways to do this but for now I am proud that the program works great.
